# Guess the Number Game

## Introduction
This simple command-line game challenges players to guess a randomly selected number within a given range. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, helping players refine their guesses. It's a great project to understand basic programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and user input handling in Python.

## Features
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Players guess numbers and receive immediate feedback.
- **Attempt Counting:** The game counts the number of guesses, improving user engagement.
- **Play Again Feature:** After a game ends, players can choose to play another round without restarting the program.

## How to Play
1. Start the game by running the Python script.
2. The game will prompt you to guess a number between 1 and 10.
3. Enter your guess in the console.
4. Receive feedback if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
5. If not guessed correctly in three tries, the game reveals the number and offers a chance to play again.

## Setup Instructions
To get the game running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites
